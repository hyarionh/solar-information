# Financing Options

Paying cash is obviously the best, but very few people can afford that. Below are the best to worst ways to finance your solar system.

### Extending Home Loan

This is the best way if possible. The interest on your home-loan is WAY lower than any other loan related way to pay for solar.

### Solar financing loan from the bank.

Some of the banks have started offering loans specifically for financing solar systems. Always check the interest rates and look out for things like balloon payments.

### Rent-to-own

With this solution you pay a monthly fee, they install the full system and after 5 years you own the system 100%.
This is a great way for anyone without the capital to go.

### Rent-only

This solution is similar to rent-to-own, however you never own the system.
Beware of this option as:

- There are annual increases on the monthly cost
- There's no end-date, so in 20 years you'd still be paying
- Sometimes there might be expensive costs if you want to cancel
