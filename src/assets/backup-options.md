# Backup Options

There is a huge variety of combinations and options, below is a general overview of options and costs, from cheapest to most expensive.

## UPS backup for wifi

**Cost**: R600~R1,500  
**Recommended brand**: Gizzu  
**Pro**: <span style="color: green">Very inexpensive </span>
**Con**: Only runs wifi/internet.

This is the cheapest option. Typically a single device about the size of your wifi router which has a battery. It will keep your wifi and fibre going during loadshedding, but not much else. Most include usb ports for charging phones.

The cheaper models will usually only last about 2 hours of loadshedding. The batteries will also typically only last about 2 years depending on how heavily they are used.

The more expensive models can last up to 8 hours and any model with "LifePO4" will have batteries with a lifespan of 5+ years (potentially 8-10 years).

## Inverter Trolley

**Cost**: R5k - R20k  
**Recommended brand**: Geewiz  
**Pro**: Mobile, can be wheeled to where you need it or packed away when there's no loadshedding.  
**Con**: Lead-acid and gel batteries die quickly, lithium is expensive.

This is the next step up. It's a box on wheels, contains a small inverter and 1 or 2 batteries. These can run small things like a TV, laptop, pc, lamp, etc. Depending what you connect to it, typically it can keep them going for 4+ hours.
There are 2 options for batteries: Lead acid and Lithium. Lead acid batteries are a lot cheaper but will typically only last a year (2 years if there's minimal load shedding). Lithium batteries cost a lot more (3x more) but will give more hours and typically last 5-10 years or more.

# Inverter Battery backup solution (permanent installation)

**Cost**: R40k-R60k
**Pro**: Cheap
**Con**: No solar to start with and poor solar features if added later

This involves an inverter installed by an electrician + battery that is connected to "essential" circuits in your house. E.g. the lights, TV, computers, etc.  
It's a battery backup only.
The amount of devices and time it can run them for depends on the size of the battery. On the lower end of the price range it would be limited. On the higher end it should be able to run multiple computers and tvs and all lights for at least 4-6 hours, if not 8 hours.

Grid-tie solar system
Cost: R60k-R80k
Pro: Solar can power entire house
Con: No battery backup

This is popular overseas but not so much here. This system has no battery but will feed the solar power into the entire house. It's primary purpose is to reduce your electricity bill.

Partial Off-grid solar system
Cost: R80k-R120k
Pro: Slightly cheaper than a proper hybrid system
Con: Very Inefficient with solar.

This used to be very commonly installed in SA but has fallen out of favour in recent years. If you see an inverter with one of the following brands, then it's this solution and you should avoid it: Axpert, RCT, Kodak, Mecer

Hybrid solar system (this is what you want to aim for idealy)
Cost: R120k+
Pro: Solar supplies the entire house. Supports batteries. Best of everything.
Cons: Cost

A hybrid inverter splits your house into 2 types of circuits. "Essential" and "Non-essential". Electricians would split your circuits for you. Things like lights, tv, computers, etc go onto the essential side and high-power plugs and devices like Stove, Microwave, Kettle, Oven, Geyser go onto the "non-essential" side.

When eskom is up, the inverter will send it's solar power to both essential and non-essential side. If the solar power isn't enough, it will take some power from eskom.  
When eskom is down, the non-essential circuits will be turned off. The essential circuits will run off the battery.
The batteries tend to be large enough to run something like a TV + 2 computers + all lights in the house for 12-20 hours. More if you can afford more batteries.
