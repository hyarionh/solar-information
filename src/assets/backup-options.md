# Backup Options

There is a huge variety of combinations and options, below is a general overview of options and costs, from cheapest to most expensive.

## UPS backup for wifi

<span class="price">**Cost**: R600~R1,500</span>  
<span class="brand">**Recommended brand**: Gizzu</span>  
<span class="pro">**Pro**:Very inexpensive </span>  
<span class="con">**Con**: Only runs wifi/internet.</span>

This is the cheapest option. Typically a single device about the size of your wifi router which has a battery. It will keep your wifi and fibre going during loadshedding, but not much else. Most include usb ports for charging phones.

The cheaper models will usually only last about 2 hours of loadshedding. The batteries will also typically only last about 2 years depending on how heavily they are used.

The more expensive models can last up to 8 hours and any model with "LifePO4" will have batteries with a lifespan of 5+ years (potentially 8-10 years).

## Inverter Trolley

<span class="price">**Cost**: R5k - R20k </span>  
<span class="brand">**Recommended brand**: Geewiz </span>  
<span class="pro">**Pro**: Mobile, can be wheeled to where you need it or packed away when there's no loadshedding.</span>  
<span class="con">**Con**: Lead-acid and gel batteries die quickly, lithium is expensive.</span>

This is the next step up. It's a box on wheels, contains a small inverter and 1 or 2 batteries. These can run small things like a TV, laptop, pc, lamp, etc. Depending what you connect to it, typically it can keep them going for 4+ hours.
There are 2 options for batteries: Lead acid and Lithium. Lead acid batteries are a lot cheaper but will typically only last a year (2 years if there's minimal load shedding). Lithium batteries cost a lot more (3x more) but will give more hours and typically last 5-10 years or more.

## Inverter Battery backup solution (permanent installation)

<span class="price">**Cost**: R40k-R60k</span>  
<span class="pro">**Pro**: Cheap</span>  
<span class="con">**Con**: No solar to start with and poor solar features if added later</span>

This involves an inverter installed by an electrician + battery that is connected to "essential" circuits in your house. E.g. the lights, TV, computers, etc.  
It's a battery backup only.
The amount of devices and time it can run them for depends on the size of the battery. On the lower end of the price range it would be limited. On the higher end it should be able to run multiple computers and tvs and all lights for at least 4-6 hours, if not 8 hours.

## Grid-tie solar system

<span class="price">Cost: R60k-R80k</span>  
<span class="pro">Pro: Solar can power entire house</span>  
<span class="con">Con: No battery backup</span>

This is popular overseas but not so much here. This system has no battery but will feed the solar power into the entire house. It's primary purpose is to reduce your electricity bill.

## Partial Hybrid solar system (Axpert inverters)

<span class="price">Cost: R80k-R120k</span>  
<span class="pro">Pro: Slightly cheaper than a proper hybrid system</span>  
<span class="con">Con: Can only power essential devices. Very Inefficient with solar on some models.</span>

These specific inverters are marketed as "Hybrid" but they are not true hybrids. They do not have a grid-tie feature, which means they can _only_ supply power to your essential devices.

This used to be very commonly installed in SA but has fallen out of favour in recent years. If you see an inverter with one of the following brands, then it's this solution and you should avoid it: Axpert, RCT, Kodak, Mecer.

## Hybrid solar system (this is what you want to aim for idealy)

<span class="price">Cost: R120k+</span>  
<span class="pro">Pro: Solar supplies the entire house. Supports batteries. Best of everything.</span>  
<span class="con">Cons: Cost</span>

A hybrid inverter splits your house into 2 types of circuits. "Essential" and "Non-essential". Electricians would split your circuits for you. Things like lights, tv, computers, etc go onto the essential side and high-power plugs and devices like Stove, Microwave, Kettle, Oven, Geyser go onto the "non-essential" side.

When eskom is up, the inverter will send it's solar power to both essential and non-essential side. If the solar power isn't enough, it will take some power from eskom.  
When eskom is down, the non-essential circuits will be turned off. The essential circuits will run off the battery.
The batteries tend to be large enough to run something like a TV + 2 computers + all lights in the house for 12-20 hours. More if you can afford more batteries.

## Off-grid solar system

<span class="price">Cost: R400k+</span>  
<span class="pro">Pro: Completed off grid, never run on eskom.</span>  
<span class="con">Cons: Prohibitively expensive</span>

Off-grid sounds great, but in practice the cost is far too high for the average person. The problem is that you have to cater for enough batteries to get through multiple days of rain (where there's not enough solar to recharge them). Instead of needing 1-2 batteries and relying on eskom for 10-30% of your power, you typically need 10 or more batteries. It also means instead of a single 5kW or 8kW inverter to supply power to your essentials, you typically need 2 or 3 inverters as you now have to be able to power every single device in the house.
