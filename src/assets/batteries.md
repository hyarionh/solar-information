# Batteries

Hardware cost: R24,000+  
Installation cost: usually bundled in with inverter installation  
Lifespan: 1-10+ years

There's a wide range of battery brands and types.

## Lead Acid

Lifespan: < 2 years.
Usable capacity: 50%  
Pros: Cheapest  
Cons: Short life-span, slow charging, can only use 50% capacity

Note: Lead acid will leak hydrogen when charging, so needs to be ventilated.

While a lead-acid _can_ last many years, this is only if you are barely using it. Any heavy usage will result in a very short life-span. With Loadshedding hitting high levels, it's not uncommon for Lead-acid batteries needing to be replaced in 6-8 months as they are being drained a lot and often not enough charging time between loadshedding slots.

## Gel / AGM

Lifespan: < 2 years.  
Usable capacity: 50%  
Pros: Almost same price as lead-acid. Slightly longer life-span. Doesn't need to be ventilated.  
Cons: Short life-span, slow charging, can only use 50% capacity

These don't usually cost much more than lead-acid, but they are a sealed unit that is safe to keep in an enclosed room.

## Lithium-ion

Lifespan 8+ years (typically). 10-20 years (if used correctly)
Usable capacity: 80%+  
Pros: Long life-span, high charge/discharge rate
Cons: Expensive initial purchase

These are larger battery banks with advanced electronics to protect the battery. They can normally do 3,000-6,000 cycles (cycle = drain and recharge).

Batteries can all get very complicated, but pretty much it boils down to the following tips:
Battery voltages must match the inverter voltage. Small inverters (particularly the off-grid/axpert ones) will sometimes be 12V or 24V. Most 5kW+ inverters will use 48V. LeadAcid/AGM/some Lithium batteries come in 12V. If you need 24V you connect 2 batteries in series. If you need 48V you need 4 in series. The bigger batteries will come in 48V normally.
LifePO4 is the best solution for a solar home. Will last the longest, supply the most and lands up cheaper than all other ones when you factor in all the maths.
Adding batteries means it costs you the same or more than sticking with Eskom. Add batteries to survive loadshedding or to go completely off-grid. Don't do it for financial reasons.
The less often a battery cycles, the longer it will last. So even a Lead-acid could last 5 years if it's not cycled daily. A LifePO4 that is only cycled during loadshedding could potentially last 20 years or more.

My personal recommendation is to only look at LifePO4 batteries, and NOT to get Pylontech brand. Pylontech is a very good brand, very respected and pushed by most installers but they are no longer competitive with the newer LifePO4 lithium batteries.

First, there are multiple "Lithium" types of batteries. The pylontechs use a different lithium chemistry to the LifePO4 ones. LifePO4 has the following pros that pylontech cannot match:
Can discharge to 0%. Pylontech will void your warranty if you do this. In fact they will void warranty if you discharge below 50%. LifePO4 will have reduced lifespan at 0%, but you will still get 3,000 cycles out of it (about 8 years).
Can discharge at 1C. This means a 4.8kWh lifePO4 battery can discharge 4,800W in an hour with no issues. Pylontech can only discharge at 0.5C. So a 4.8kW pylontech can only provide up to 2,400W of power. Meaning you need 2 of them for a 4.8kW inverter. Also, if you force it to discharge higher than 0.5C you void the warranty.
