Currently this is not worthwhile at all. In other countries this works very well, you feed back extra solar during the day to the power company at a reduced rate and at night you pay for getting power back from them.

Due to regulations, Eskom monopoly, etc. it's not viable in SA yet, even though it's allowed.
To feed back currently in CoCT:
You have to pay R12k for them to install a special pre-paid meter allowing you to feed back.
You have to pay a monthly fee for the "benefit of selling your power". I think this is around R150 or R250 per month.
CoCT will pay you R0.25 per kWh you give them.
CoCT will charge you R2.40 per kWh you take from them.
You have to be a 'net consumer'. This means you have to use more electricity than you give them. i.e. If you use 100kWh from CoCT over the year, they will only pay you back for up to100kWh of Solar you give them. If you give them 300kWh, the remaining 200kWh they take for free.
In comparison, in Australia they also require the net-consumer rule. However they pay 50% of the price per kWh. If CoCT did this it would mean you get a credit of R1.20 per kWh you send to the city.

Registration with CoCT
Your solar installer will assist with this but will likely charge for the admin work. If you're happy to do the admin work yourself you can save a few grand. Involves filling in documents (solar installer will probably do this bit for you for free) and then submitting, correcting, updating, jumping through hoops for the CoCT department. Once approved the installation can happen and afterwards they will send an inspector to verify everything is up to code.

There is a fee from CoCT but I can't recall what it is. I don't recall it being high.

Partial installation options
You can opt to install half a system initially if it make sense budget wise, although bearing in mind some installation costs would land up being duplicated when adding the 2nd half later.

e.g. you could install inverter + battery only to survive loadshedding. Then later on have the solar panels installed. Or you could install inverter + solar panels and install a battery later on.

Potential cost savings

Calculating how much power one can save is no easy task. Even after having graphs and numbers to play with I still don't have a perfect excel sheet, but I will give you hopefully sufficient information to help you get a rough estimate.

These are based on personal experience and may differ for you:
About 40% of our usage is outside of sunlight times. So if you use say 20kWh per day, no amount of solar panels on their own will cover the full 20kWh unless you have sufficient batteries.
Batteries are expensive and not really a cost saving (although latest eskom increase means they're a few cents cheaper per kWh than eskom now), so buying extra batteries to "use the additional solar power" might be a wasted expense.
If you're on Eskom directly, you'll be paying a much cheaper rate than CoCT and you need to adjust calculations accordingly.

We use approx. 20-25kWh per day.
A 2kW set of panels is producing about 6-8kWh of power per day in winter and 10-12kWh in summer.
At CoCT rates for 2020, R2.10 per kWh, this meant up to R26 saving per day (R750/month)
At CoCT rates for 2021, R2.40 per kWh that means even more.
If you use more than 600kWh per month, it also means the units over the first 600 are even higher, 2021 rates are R3.32/kWh.
This means if your solar can reduce your eskom usage below 600kWh per month, you save a lot.

I'd recommend basing the savings being on around 50% of your bill.
Using excel you can try extrapolate to cater for increases in Eskom rates and to figure out savings per year.

In general, if you are specifically looking at the savings, you are probably looking at 10-14 years to recover the cost of the system - if eskom doesn't increase prices. If eskom increases by 15% each year that drops to < 7 years.
