I'm not sure of the extend of the changes as the electrical side was done when we bought the house, but from what I understand a solar installer will do the following in the process:
Split your DB into 2 DBs
Old DB = non-essentials and high-power items. e.g. geyser, kettle, stove
New DB = essentials (basically everything that will run on battery). In our case this is every light breaker and at least 1 plug point per room.
As part of the inverter installation there will be additional stuff such as fuse for battery, breakers for solar panels, inverter, etc, and changeovers for things like if you need to bypass the inverter.

Batteries
Hardware cost: R24,000+
Installation cost: usually bundled in with inverter installation
Lifespan: 2-10+ years

There's a wide range of battery brands and types.

The different battery types typically used:
Lead Acid or AGM. Lifespan < 2 years. Lead acid will leak hydrogen when charging, so needs to be ventilated. AGM is sealed, so can be installed anywhere.

Lithium-ion. Lifespan 5-8 years (typically). These are larger battery banks with advanced electronics to protect the battery. They can normally do 3,000+ cycles (cycle = drain and recharge). They should not be drained below 50% or lifespan drops drastically (like down to 300 cycles). They are also limited in how much power they can output at once. e.g. a 2kWh battery can only supply 1kW of power at a time to devices.

LifePO4 (Lithium-Iron-Phosphate). Lifespan 10+ years. These look similar to Lithium-ion, are often just called "Lithium" but are newer and better. They do 6,000+ cycles if you drain down to 80%. They will still do 3,000+ cycles if you drain to 0% (completely flat). They also can supply the full power rating. So a 2kWh can supply 2kW of power at a time.

Batteries can all get very complicated, but pretty much it boils down to the following tips:
Battery voltages must match the inverter voltage. Small inverters (particularly the off-grid/axpert ones) will sometimes be 12V or 24V. Most 5kW+ inverters will use 48V. LeadAcid/AGM/some Lithium batteries come in 12V. If you need 24V you connect 2 batteries in series. If you need 48V you need 4 in series. The bigger batteries will come in 48V normally.
LifePO4 is the best solution for a solar home. Will last the longest, supply the most and lands up cheaper than all other ones when you factor in all the maths.
Adding batteries means it costs you the same or more than sticking with Eskom. Add batteries to survive loadshedding or to go completely off-grid. Don't do it for financial reasons.
The less often a battery cycles, the longer it will last. So even a Lead-acid could last 5 years if it's not cycled daily. A LifePO4 that is only cycled during loadshedding could potentially last 20 years or more.

My personal recommendation is to only look at LifePO4 batteries, and NOT to get Pylontech brand. Pylontech is a very good brand, very respected and pushed by most installers but they are no longer competitive with the newer LifePO4 lithium batteries.

First, there are multiple "Lithium" types of batteries. The pylontechs use a different lithium chemistry to the LifePO4 ones. LifePO4 has the following pros that pylontech cannot match:
Can discharge to 0%. Pylontech will void your warranty if you do this. In fact they will void warranty if you discharge below 50%. LifePO4 will have reduced lifespan at 0%, but you will still get 3,000 cycles out of it (about 8 years).
Can discharge at 1C. This means a 4.8kWh lifePO4 battery can discharge 4,800W in an hour with no issues. Pylontech can only discharge at 0.5C. So a 4.8kW pylontech can only provide up to 2,400W of power. Meaning you need 2 of them for a 4.8kW inverter. Also, if you force it to discharge higher than 0.5C you void the warranty.

Feeding back into Eskom/CoCT
Currently this is not worthwhile at all. In other countries this works very well, you feed back extra solar during the day to the power company at a reduced rate and at night you pay for getting power back from them.

Due to regulations, Eskom monopoly, etc. it's not viable in SA yet, even though it's allowed.
To feed back currently in CoCT:
You have to pay R12k for them to install a special pre-paid meter allowing you to feed back.
You have to pay a monthly fee for the "benefit of selling your power". I think this is around R150 or R250 per month.
CoCT will pay you R0.25 per kWh you give them.
CoCT will charge you R2.40 per kWh you take from them.
You have to be a 'net consumer'. This means you have to use more electricity than you give them. i.e. If you use 100kWh from CoCT over the year, they will only pay you back for up to100kWh of Solar you give them. If you give them 300kWh, the remaining 200kWh they take for free.
In comparison, in Australia they also require the net-consumer rule. However they pay 50% of the price per kWh. If CoCT did this it would mean you get a credit of R1.20 per kWh you send to the city.

Registration with CoCT
Your solar installer will assist with this but will likely charge for the admin work. If you're happy to do the admin work yourself you can save a few grand. Involves filling in documents (solar installer will probably do this bit for you for free) and then submitting, correcting, updating, jumping through hoops for the CoCT department. Once approved the installation can happen and afterwards they will send an inspector to verify everything is up to code.

There is a fee from CoCT but I can't recall what it is. I don't recall it being high.

Partial installation options
You can opt to install half a system initially if it make sense budget wise, although bearing in mind some installation costs would land up being duplicated when adding the 2nd half later.

e.g. you could install inverter + battery only to survive loadshedding. Then later on have the solar panels installed. Or you could install inverter + solar panels and install a battery later on.

Potential cost savings

Calculating how much power one can save is no easy task. Even after having graphs and numbers to play with I still don't have a perfect excel sheet, but I will give you hopefully sufficient information to help you get a rough estimate.

These are based on personal experience and may differ for you:
About 40% of our usage is outside of sunlight times. So if you use say 20kWh per day, no amount of solar panels on their own will cover the full 20kWh unless you have sufficient batteries.
Batteries are expensive and not really a cost saving (although latest eskom increase means they're a few cents cheaper per kWh than eskom now), so buying extra batteries to "use the additional solar power" might be a wasted expense.
If you're on Eskom directly, you'll be paying a much cheaper rate than CoCT and you need to adjust calculations accordingly.

We use approx. 20-25kWh per day.
A 2kW set of panels is producing about 6-8kWh of power per day in winter and 10-12kWh in summer.
At CoCT rates for 2020, R2.10 per kWh, this meant up to R26 saving per day (R750/month)
At CoCT rates for 2021, R2.40 per kWh that means even more.
If you use more than 600kWh per month, it also means the units over the first 600 are even higher, 2021 rates are R3.32/kWh.
This means if your solar can reduce your eskom usage below 600kWh per month, you save a lot.

I'd recommend basing the savings being on around 50% of your bill.
Using excel you can try extrapolate to cater for increases in Eskom rates and to figure out savings per year.

In general, if you are specifically looking at the savings, you are probably looking at 10-14 years to recover the cost of the system - if eskom doesn't increase prices. If eskom increases by 15% each year that drops to < 7 years.
